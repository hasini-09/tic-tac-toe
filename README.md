TIC-TAC-TOE:
This implements a simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game for a 3x3 matrix. Players alternate turns to fill the board, with Player 1 using the value 9 (representing "X") and Player 2 using the value 6 (representing "O"). The program checks for winning conditions after each move, displays the current state of the board and declares the winner if a player completes a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends in a draw if no player wins after all moves.

This project serves as:

Entertainment: A quick and fun game for two players.
Learning Tool: An example of how to use arrays, loops, and conditional statements in C programming.
Practice for Beginners: Introduces user input, validation, and logic implementation concepts in coding.
Foundation for Enhancements: Can be expanded to include features like a GUI, AI opponent, or larger grids.
